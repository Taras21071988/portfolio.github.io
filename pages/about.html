            Hi, I'm Taras, a beginner Frontend developer, I've been studying
            this direction for more than a year, the technologies I've studied
            include: HTML, CSS, SCSS, JavaScript, TypeScript (Beginner level),
            React, Gulp, Git. I like to create web pages that will bring
            pleasure to the user from their visit, work with animation on pages.
            I would be glad to work in a team of specialists on a large project
            that uses modern development tools and technologies. But also would
            be happy to work on the creation of landing pages.
          </p>
          <p class="about__text mb-5 fs-m">
            Interested in development began in school, then entered the Kharkiv
            National University of Radioelectronics on the specialty - software
            for automatic systems, and in parallel began to work practically in
            the specialty. Starting in 2015 and until 2023, I was engaged in
            setting up equipment, the software part of which was very similar to
            the blueprint system Unreal Engine. In the process of work had to
            take into account many nuances that changed in real time.

          <p class="about__text mb-5 fs-m">
            At the moment I got a grant based on my skills to study at QALight,
            where I got the opportunity to communicate with teachers and mentors
            who have a great experience in development and teamwork. Inspired by
            their level I am trying to improve my skills to reach a level that
            will allow me to say that I am at the same level, and in the future
            to surpass them.
          </p>
          <p class="about__text mb-5 fs-m">
            I will be glad to receive an offer to work in a team to which there
            will be an opportunity to improve my skills and realize new
            knowledge in practice.
